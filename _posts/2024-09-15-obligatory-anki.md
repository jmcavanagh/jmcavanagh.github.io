title:  "Using Anki for Science and Math"

Lots of people use Anki for learning languages or trying to memorize lots of facts in medical school. There are also lots of other uses, from memorizing poems to programming languages. You can use it to connect faces to names if you're not a face person, memorize quotes to sound wiser than you are, or even how to tie knots. Here, though, I'm going to focus on making an easy-to-read, skimmable guide on how I've used it to study science and math.

# What I do
#### Definitions
The first and most obvious thing that I thought of memorizing with Anki are definitions. Definitions might sound arbitrary, but you'll need to know them if you're going to read papers. Often, definitions also point to very useful concepts for understanding the world--- and at the end of the day, it's this concept that you'll want to know. This is why I prefer cards asking me to define a term to cards asking me to give a term corresponding to a definition. Typically I prefer the "cloze typing" format for this.

A first order phase transition is one which has {{c1::a discontinuity in the first derivative of Free Energy}}

#### Connecting concepts to the real world
I also like having go-to examples for my cards. I've found that examples connecting to the real world help me remember a concept and think more concretely about that topic.

Transition from liquid to gas is a {{c1::first}}-order transition.

#### Numbers of things
I've found that a lot of expert intuition takes the form of knowing the relative sizes of various things. This is great for sanity-checking, making connections, visualizing, analogizing, and all sorts of other goodness. Knowing a single number is trivia, but knowing a web of numbers and their connections to each other is an intuition.

(I learned about this method from Drake Thomas, who does this and has an intuitive understanding the sizes of things that I have not seen matched)

#### Proofs and derivations.
You can also use anki to memorize proofs, derivations of physical principles, or chain-of-thought reasoning by outlining the proof and using fill-in-the-blank (cloze) deletions on multiple steps. This means that you'll get quizzed on completing or justifying every step of the proof, given the rest of the proof as context. This can be tedious to make, and require a complete understanding of the proof, yet are *extraordinarily powerful* when done well. I can reproduce, entirely from my head, a proof for why the squareroot of 2 is irrational or the reason why minimizing the free energy of a system in the canonical ensemble is equivalent to maximizing the universe's entropy (and also the assumptions that go into these)

(I learned about this from Paul Raymond-Robichaud, a master of this method who's talked about it on youtube. Paul has memorized tons of proofs of things he finds interesting and it's left him with a great ability to prove things rigorously, and explain his proofs so they make sense to a simple chemist like me)

#### Reasons for why things are the way they are
Another great thing to do is to memorize the *reasons* for why things are the way they are, which works great for algorithms and biology (anything which is, in some sense, designed to serve a certain purpose).

#### Explanations for how things happen
Another type of card that I like are cards that ask how something happens. A common format I like is to show a picture fo a process and then ask something like "how does this happen". These can get out of hand easily (as in, it's easy to make cards that ask too much and take too much effort. These are called "leeches" and you want to destroy them every time you find them; spaced repetition is supposed to be nearly effortless). Typically these cards don't involve explaining more than two "steps" of a process.
